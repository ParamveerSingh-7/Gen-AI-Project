# **Terminal AI Chatbot**

## **Overview**

The **Terminal AI Chatbot** is an interactive AI-powered chatbot that simulates real-world negotiation scenarios. Users can negotiate the price of a product with an AI salesperson, who responds with realistic counter-offers and justifications based on product features, competitor prices, and customer loyalty.

This assistant leverages Google's Gemini Generative AI for dynamic, context-aware negotiation, making it ideal for practicing negotiation skills or simulating business sales interactions.
